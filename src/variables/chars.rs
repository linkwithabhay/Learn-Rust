/// # Char
///
/// A char is a single character (For example: 1, 6, %, b, p, ., T, etc.)
///
/// The char type is a special type that consists of a single character.
///
/// To initialize a char value in a variable, enclose it within single quotation marks:
/// ```rust
/// let c1: char = 'h';
/// ```
///
/// In the above example, a char variable named `c1` is initialized.
///
/// ## Challenge
///
/// Store the char `'C'` in a variable named `initial`.
pub fn learn() {
    // Type your code below
    let initial: char = 'C';

    // Don't change the line below
    println!("initial = '{}'", initial);
}
